# Approach:

Just to cover my bases, I started by just opening the file in Notepad. As suspected, this yielded nothing but gibberish, so I turned to PowerShell and booted up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Let's see what happens if I just:

```console
jasperjjhe@machine:~/constructor$ ./chall
ðŸ‘€
```

Okay, wasn't expecting it to be that easy anyway.

```console
jasperjjhe@machine:~/constructor$ gdb ./chall

```

No debugging symbols means I'll have to find the insertion point manually. While I'm at it, it's a good idea to look for `.init_array`, too.

```console
jasperjjhe@machine:~/constructor$ readelf -h ./chall | grep "Entry point"
  Entry point address:               0x40118b
jasperjjhe@machine:~/constructor$ readelf -S ./chall | grep init_array
  [ 6] .init_array INIT_ARRAY 0000000000404fb0 00003fb0
```

So now I know where our entry point is in this program, which means I can set a breakpoint!

```console
jasperjjhe@machine:~/constructor$ gdb ./chall

```

Even though the symbols have been intentionally removed, I've found the actual address of the program's entry point, so I can set that as a breakpoint:

```console
(gdb) break *0x40118b
Breakpoint 1 at 0x40118b
(gdb) run
Starting program: ~/constructor/chall

Breakpoint 1, 0x000000000040118b in ?? ()
```

Great! We are paused right at the beginning of the program. Let's examine four 8-byte values in `.init_array` which we know the address of from before.

```console
(gdb) x/4gx 0x404fb0
0x404fb0:       0x0000000000401290      0x0000000000401030
0x404fc0:       0x0000000000401050      0x0000000000401250
```

These new addresses probably point to functions; we'll set more breakpoints for them.

```console
(gdb) break *0x401290
Breakpoint 2 at 0x401290
(gdb) break *0x401050
Breakpoint 3 at 0x401050
(gdb) continue
Continuing.

Breakpoint 2, 0x0000000000401290 in ?? ()
```

We've probably hit a function, let's take a look at it.

```console
(gdb) x/20i $rip
=> 0x401290:    endbr64
   0x401294:    jmp    0x401210
   0x401299:    nopl   0x0(%rax)
   0x4012a0:    endbr64
   0x4012a4:    ret
   0x4012a5:    cs nopw 0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
   0x4012af:    nop
   0x4012b0:    endbr64
   0x4012b4:    ret
   0x4012b5:    cs nopw 0x0(%rax,%rax,1)
   0x4012bf:    nop
   0x4012c0:    endbr64
   0x4012c4:    sub    $0x158,%rsp
   0x4012cb:    mov    %rdi,%rdx
   0x4012ce:    xor    %eax,%eax
   0x4012d0:    mov    $0x26,%ecx
   0x4012d5:    lea    0x20(%rsp),%r8
   0x4012da:    mov    %r8,%rdi
   0x4012dd:    rep stos %rax,%es:(%rdi)
   0x4012e0:    mov    $0x405628,%rax
```
