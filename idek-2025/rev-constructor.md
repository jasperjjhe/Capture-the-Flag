# Approach:

Just to cover my bases, I started by just opening the file in Notepad. As suspected, this yielded nothing but gibberish, so I turned to PowerShell and booted up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Let's see what happens if I just:

```console
jasperjjhe@machine:~/constructor$ ./chall
ðŸ‘€
```

Okay, wasn't expecting it to be that easy anyway.

```console
jasperjjhe@machine:~/constructor$ gdb ./chall

```

No debugging symbols means I'll have to find the insertion point manually.

```console
jasperjjhe@machine:~/constructor$ readelf -h ./chall | grep "Entry point"
  Entry point address:               0x40118b
```

So now I know where our entry point is in this program, which means I can set a breakpoint!

```console
jasperjjhe@machine:~/constructor$ gdb ./chall

```

Even though the symbols have been intentionally removed, I've found the actual address of the program's entry point, so I can set that as a breakpoint:

```console
(gdb) break *0x40118b
Breakpoint 1 at 0x40118b
(gdb) run
Starting program: ~/constructor/chall

Breakpoint 1, 0x000000000040118b in ?? ()
(gdb)
```

Great! We are paused right at the beginning of the program.
