This repository contains my approaches to various challenges I've encountered in [capture-the-flag hacking tournaments (CTFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)). Each folder contains challenges from a single CTF, with Markdown files containing my thought process and downloads from the original challenge.

The original challenges were created by each CTF, respectively, and are credited in the Markdown files.
